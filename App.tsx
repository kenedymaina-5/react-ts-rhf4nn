        When it comes to running React.js code online, there are several
        platforms available that allow you to create and test your applications.
        One such platform is StackBlitz, which provides a seamless online
        development environment. In the provided code snippet, a basic React.js
        application is defined using functional components. The App component is
        exported as the default component for the application. Inside the App
        component, a div element is created to contain the content of the
        application. Within the div, there is an h1 element with the text "Hello
        StackBlitz!" and a p element with the text "Start editing to see some
        magic happen :)". These elements are styled using the CSS file imported
        through the import './style.css' statement. By utilizing StackBlitz or
        similar online platforms, you can easily run and test your React.js
        code. Simply make changes to the code, save it, and observe the magic
        happen in real-time as the application updates and renders the changes
        you made. These platforms provide a convenient way to experiment,
        collaborate, and showcase your React.js projects.
